#+title: Ubuntu Server Installation and Setup

* Flash the ISO onto a USB drive
You can follow these steps to flash an Ubuntu ISO onto a USB drive.

Your drive needs to be at least 2GB in size.

1. Download the Ubuntu image you want to flash
2. Download [[https://etcher.balena.io/#download-etcher][Etcher]]
   We will use this to do the flashing
3. Use Etcher to flash the drive

* Boot Ubuntu on Computer
1. Insert the USB drive
2. On Mac:
   - Power on Mac computer then press and hold the option/alt key until
    you see the bootable devices
   - Select the golden device titled EFI Boot

* Proceed with installation
Select Try or Install Ubuntu and proceed with the installation
steps. You'll need to connect to ethernet in order for the internet to
work during installation.

* Get wifi working
Wifi may work by default. Run this to check if a wireless interface is
present:

#+begin_src shell
  ls /sys/class/net | grep -i wlp
#+end_src

Example output: wlp2s0

If it is, then proceed to Update Netplan step.

** On Mac
To get wifi working follow the steps outlined [[https://askubuntu.com/a/1175754][here]] and [[https://yping88.medium.com/how-to-enable-wi-fi-on-ubuntu-server-20-04-without-a-wired-ethernet-connection-42e0b71ca198][here]] which are
explained below.

The following commands assumes you have a BCM4331 wifi chip installed
which can be found by running:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo lspci -v | grep "Network" -C 10
#+end_src

If you have a different chip the 3 commands below may not work for
you.

Install the required BCM packages:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo apt-get --reinstall install bcmwl-kernel-source
  sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb wl brcmfmac brcmsmac bcma
  sudo modprobe wl
#+end_src

Continue with Generic Instructions

** Generic Instructions 
Install wpasupplicant, libnl-route-3â€“200, and libpcsclite1.

Get the wireless interface name:

#+begin_src shell
  ls /sys/class/net | grep -i wlp
#+end_src

We will assume the output of this is wlp2s0 in our configuration
below.

** Update Netplan
Make a backup of your netplan: /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml.

Edit /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml:

#+begin_example
  network:
      ethernets:
          enp1s0f0:
              optional: true
              dhcp4: true
      wifis:
          wlp2s0:
              dhcp4: true
              optional: true
              access-points:
                  "SSID":
                      password: "password"
      version: 2
      renderer: networkd
#+end_example

Make sure to set optional to true as the default will prevent the
computer from fully starting up if no network connection is detected.

Debug the plan to see if there are any issues:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo netplan --debug generate
#+end_src

If everything looks good then apply the changes:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo netplan apply
#+end_src

Finally, reboot your system. Everything should be working now.

* Update device storage
When installing a new Linux distro you may need to extend the file
system to make all storage space available [1]:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo vgdisplay
  sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
  sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-ubuntu--lv
#+end_src

vgdisplay will give you the name of the volume group. In our example
that is ubuntu-vg. If we use df -h / we see that the name of the file
system we want to increae includes ubuntu-vg.

lvextend will add the space to the volume.

resize2fs will extend the file system.
