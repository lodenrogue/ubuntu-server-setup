#+title: SSH into server using hostname setup with avahi

We may want to ssh into a server using its hostname rather than its ip
address like this:

ssh user@hostname.local

To achieve this we need to install some packages on the server:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo apt install avahi-daemon avahi-utils
#+end_src

Then enable and start the service:

#+begin_src shell
  sudo systemctl enable --now avahi-daemon
#+end_src
